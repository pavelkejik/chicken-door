## Project Overview
The project automates everyday coop duties by combining a **smart sliding door**, a set of battery-powered **accessories** (feeder, camera, ‚Ä¶) and a modern web UI.  
The door acts as the **gateway**: it drives the motor, pairs with accessories over low-power **ESP-NOW**, exposes a local **Web UI + HTTP API**, and bridges everything to standard **MQTT** and optional **Modbus RTU** for seamless Home-Assistant integration.

## Core Features
| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
|Automation|‚Ä¢ Auto-open/close by **sunrise/sunset** (astronomical) or **ambient light** plus configurable offsets  <br>‚Ä¢ Full manual override via button, Web UI, MQTT, or Modbus|
|Safety|‚Ä¢ Encoder-based position tracking, upper/lower limit calibration, soft-start/stop  <br>‚Ä¢ Stall/over-current detection, timeout watchdog, emergency-stop state|
|Connectivity|‚Ä¢ Wi-Fi STA/AP, **ESP-NOW** for accessories (1 km LR)  <br>‚Ä¢ MQTT (via configurable `base_topic`), HTTP/REST, captive portal|
|Updates|‚Ä¢ **OTA** firmware & file-system updates for door *and* every paired accessory through ESP-NOW|
|Accessories|‚Ä¢ **Smart Feeder** ‚Äì scheduled or weight-based servings  <br>‚Ä¢ **Coop Camera** ‚Äì still images on demand  <br>_Add your own!_  |
|Power|Door on 12 V DC; accessories battery-powered for months thanks to deep-sleep design|

## System Architecture
```
ESP32-S3 Door  ‚îÄ‚îÄ Wi-Fi STA ‚áÜ Home Network ‚áÜ MQTT Broker / Home Assistant
      ‚îÇ
      ‚îú‚îÄ Wi-Fi AP (for first-run config)
      ‚îî‚îÄ ESP-NOW P2P
             ‚îú‚îÄ Feeder (ESP32-C3, battery)
             ‚îî‚îÄ Camera (ESP32-S3, battery)
```
Door firmware is C++/Arduino on FreeRTOS; the web interface is Vite + Vue 3 + Vuetify served directly from on-board **LittleFS**.

## Hardware
### Chicken Door (Gateway)
* **Drive**: 12 V DC gear-motor + rack-and-pinion (self-locking)  
* **MCU**: ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 (8 MB PSRAM)  
* **Sensors**: quadrature encoder, NTC temperature, photodiode (light)  
* **IO Expansion**: 2 GPIO inputs, open-collector output, RS-485 (Modbus RTU)  
* **Indicators**: bi-color status LED

### Accessories
| Name | Repo | Brief |
|------|------|-------|
|Smart Feeder|<https://github.com/pavelkejik/chicken-feeder>|Servo-lid + load-cell; daily schedule or ‚Äúfeed-to-weight‚Äù mode|
|Coop Camera|<https://github.com/pavelkejik/chicken-camera>|ESP32-S3 w/ OV2640; images send over ESP-NOW|

Each accessory ships its own OTA-updatable firmware and pairs with one click via the Web UI. Status appears alongside the door dashboard.

## Communication & APIs
| Layer | Tech | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
|Local Web UI|`http://dvirka.local` (mDNS) or captive portal |Full config, live telemetry, manual commands|
|REST/JSON|`/api/door`, `/api/accessory/{id}`|Same parameter map as MQTT|
|MQTT|`<base_topic>/state/...` and `/set/...` |Door & all accessories share a unified schema|
|Modbus RTU|RS-485, 9600 8N1 |Minimal register map for industrial PLCs|
|ESP-NOW|1 Mbit/s (500 kbit/s LR) |door = server, accessories = clients|

---

## Safety & Reliability
* **Hard limits + soft position** ensure gentle landings and no unexpected slams.  
* Every motion path is guarded by current & timeout watchdogs; any fault triggers _Emergency Stop_ with MQTT/HTTP event.  
* Door refuses to auto-close if position => `UNKNOWN` until next recalibration pass.  
* Accessories inherit door time-base and watchdog pings to detect battery loss.

---

## Getting Started
### 1. Flash Firmware
```bash
# Door
cd firmware/door
pio run -t upload         # USB
pio run -t uploadfs       # Web assets
# Feeder / Camera similar...
```

### 2. First Boot & Wi-Fi Join
1. Hold the door‚Äôs button >3 s ‚Üí it starts `Dvirka` AP (both LEDs solid).  
2. Connect with a phone, open any page ‚Üí captive portal shows config.  
3. Enter your SSID/PSK; the door reboots and joins STA mode.  

### 3. Build the Web UI Locally (optional)
```bash
cd web-ui
npm i
npm run dev
```

### 4. Pair Accessories
Open **Menu ‚Üí Accessories ‚Üí ‚ÄúNew‚Äù ‚Üí Pair** and press the accessory button once. State flips from _New_ ‚Üí _Connected_.

## MQTT Quick Reference
```text
<base_topic>/state/position        = "OPEN" | "CLOSED" | "OPENING" | ...
<base_topic>/state/light_lux       = 123
<base_topic>/set/command           ‚Üê "OPEN" | "CLOSE" | "STOP"

<base_topic>/devices/<id>/state/weight_g
```
Replace `<base_topic>` in the Web UI.

---

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add waterer accessory
- [ ] Implement chicken presence counting using RFID tags   
- [x] Publish 3D-print STLs & KiCad sources
